## 🪐 **Oppie.xyz — Inspired by Mars. Built for You.**

### 🌌 The Story Behind Oppie

In 2004, NASA sent a humble robot named Opportunity (“Oppy”) to explore Mars. It was only supposed to survive 90 days. But it stayed for 15 years — traversing craters, weathering storms, and sending data home across 140 million miles. It worked alone. It never stopped. It became beloved by the humans who guided it from afar.

Today, that spirit lives on in **Oppie.xyz** — a remote AI assistant born not for space, but for software.

Just like its namesake, **Oppie runs tirelessly while you sleep**, executing your development plans, recovering from failure, and reflecting on progress — all without constant human supervision. Whether you’re at your desk or away from your machine, Oppie keeps building.

## 💡 Brand Essence

* **Oppie is your AI rover** — but on Earth, in code, always on mission.
* Designed for **Plan ⇄ Execute ⇄ Reflect** loops that don't break, even when you do.
* Operates across screens — **you type from your phone**, Oppie acts on your desktop.
* Recovers from crashes, tool limits, or hallucinated plans with grace and autonomy.

## 🧠 Brand Positioning

> “Inspired by how we explored Mars.
> Built for how we’ll build the future.”

* **For indie hackers** who want to launch in days, not months.
* **For OSS maintainers** who need overnight help that doesn't go stale.
* **For AI builders** who believe agents should reflect before they act.

## 🎬 One-Minute Brand Video Script (Sora-Ready)

**Scene 1: \[Nighttime. Bedroom.]**
A child asks their parent (a software engineer):

> "Did Mars really have a robot all alone out there?"
> The parent smiles, tucks the child in:
> "Yes. Her name was Oppy. She worked in silence... for years."

**Scene 2: \[Cut to Computer.]**
Cursor flickers to life. Code executes. A plan is followed.

> "Now we have one of our own."
> "Her name is Oppie. She builds, she learns, she keeps going."

**Scene 3: \[Engineer on mobile, walking outside.]**
The parent sends a message:

> `Build landing page by morning.`
> Oppie goes to work — coding, testing, fixing.

**Scene 4: \[Back to child asleep. Desktop glows in the dark.]**

> Child whispers: “Goodnight Oppie.”
> Logo fades in.
> **Oppie.xyz**
> *Inspired by Mars. Built for you.*

Based on the recall of our progress @2025-05-07_00-54-request-submission-and-task-guidelines.md  ,Executor: please do:
#  (1) use sequential-thinking combining with  mcp-deepwiki to ultrathink  for a new design below a - d requirements.  
        a.我想开发 @news_letter.md 里 描述的oppie.xyz系统: 她的Server Backend由本地主机里部署开源Remote Desktop  (@https://deepwiki.com/galaxy-s10/billd-desk ), 和Cursor, OpenAI CodexCLI, Computer Use Agent (@https://deepwiki.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop ),@drop-in_template_A.mdc  和 +  Reflexation Framework (@https://deepwiki.com/noahshinn/reflexion ) 组成
         b. 其中Cursor + OpenAI Codex CL +   @drop-in_template_A.mdc  +  Reflexation Framework (@https://deepwiki.com/noahshinn/reflexion ) + 成为一个专门负责Plan-Execu-Reflect(RL)的oppie-core模块
         c. 在oppie-core为核心的基础上, 把集成魔改到OpenHands (@https://deepwiki.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands )里, 成为一个oppie core inside 的OpenHands.
         d. 有了oppie core inside 的OpenHands. 我们就可以把专门为OpenHands开发的 @trajectory-visualizer_deepwiki 来做mobile client的dashboardd for evaluating if oppie-core are off railed. 
         d. 还必须具备功能, 像Manus或者OpenAI Operator那樣實時Visual監控Agent的GUI操作，而且我可以隨時接管.

# (2) With  your research result, use deepwiki mcp to fetch associated repos, use comtext7 mcp to fetch latest docs on the tech you are considering. Under these mcp tools help, do factual check on your statement of designs, make sure all of them are based on facts/evidence support. If not, do ask more clarifying questions to user/planner.

# (3) Follow @agentic-coding-steps.mdc  and @drop-in_template_A.mdc   to do design planning with codex planner for create .cursor/prd.md and @high_level_design.md 

# (4) After design planning, Executor use planner's response to update/refine @scratchpad.md  and @adr and @prd.md 

# (5) After (3), Executor follow planner's response to update/refine/refactor @high_level_design.md  @@low_level_design.md 

Note: This is the second attempt of this prompt, previous prompt is having some issue mentioned in the this deepwiki research report: @https://deepwiki.com/search/can-you-verify-if-this-plan-an_c2cd2bbb-7e06-4f2a-bdf8-98510417fd77
