## 🪐 **Oppie.xyz — Inspired by Mars. Built for You.**

### 🌌 The Story Behind Oppie

In 2004, NASA sent a humble robot named Opportunity (“Oppy”) to explore Mars. It was only supposed to survive 90 days. But it stayed for 15 years — traversing craters, weathering storms, and sending data home across 140 million miles. It worked alone. It never stopped. It became beloved by the humans who guided it from afar.

Today, that spirit lives on in **Oppie.xyz** — a remote AI assistant born not for space, but for software.

Just like its namesake, **Oppie runs tirelessly while you sleep**, executing your development plans, recovering from failure, and reflecting on progress — all without constant human supervision. Whether you’re at your desk or away from your machine, Oppie keeps building.

## 💡 Brand Essence

* **Oppie is your AI rover** — but on Earth, in code, always on mission.
* Designed for **Plan ⇄ Execute ⇄ Reflect** loops that don't break, even when you do.
* Operates across screens — **you type from your phone**, Oppie acts on your desktop.
* Recovers from crashes, tool limits, or hallucinated plans with grace and autonomy.

## 🧠 Brand Positioning

> “Inspired by how we explored Mars.
> Built for how we’ll build the future.”

* **For indie hackers** who want to launch in days, not months.
* **For OSS maintainers** who need overnight help that doesn't go stale.
* **For AI builders** who believe agents should reflect before they act.

## 🎬 One-Minute Brand Video Script (Sora-Ready)

**Scene 1: \[Nighttime. Bedroom.]**
A child asks their parent (a software engineer):

> "Did Mars really have a robot all alone out there?"
> The parent smiles, tucks the child in:
> "Yes. Her name was Oppy. She worked in silence... for years."

**Scene 2: \[Cut to Computer.]**
Cursor flickers to life. Code executes. A plan is followed.

> "Now we have one of our own."
> "Her name is Oppie. She builds, she learns, she keeps going."

**Scene 3: \[Engineer on mobile, walking outside.]**
The parent sends a message:

> `Build landing page by morning.`
> Oppie goes to work — coding, testing, fixing.

**Scene 4: \[Back to child asleep. Desktop glows in the dark.]**

> Child whispers: “Goodnight Oppie.”
> Logo fades in.
> **Oppie.xyz**
> *Inspired by Mars. Built for you.*
