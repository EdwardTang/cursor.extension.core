**Prompt:**

Write a detailed security guideline document for a modern web application that includes the following sections:

1. **Requirements & Analysis** 
   - List and explain critical requirements for secure coding and application resilience, including handling order processing, concurrency, temperature-aware shelves, overflow management, order lifecycle, logging, and configuration management.

2. **High-Level Architecture & Key Components**
   - Describe essential classes (e.g., Order, Shelf, KitchenManager) with properties and operations.

3. **Security & Concurrency Considerations**
   - Outline secure coding principles and concurrency solutions to mitigate risks.

4. **Detailed Implementation Steps**
   - Provide step-by-step implementation instructions, including:
     - Project setup
     - Core model definitions
     - Business logic specifics
     - Integration with external services
     - Configuration management
     - Logging practices
     - Testing methodologies
5. **Code Example Snippets**
   - Include code snippets for critical components such as the Shelf class and KitchenManager logic.

6. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Discuss deployment strategies using CI/CD, security monitoring, and incident management.

7. **Final Review & Documentation**
   - Emphasize the importance of thorough documentation, code reviews, and operational procedures.

Ensure the document is formatted with clear headings and bullet points for easy navigation. Aim for approximately 3000-4000 words, maintaining a logical flow and depth in each section while addressing both functional and security requirements for the application.
