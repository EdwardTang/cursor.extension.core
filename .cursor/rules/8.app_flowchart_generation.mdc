**Prompt:**  
Create a flowchart for a digital product process using the Mermaid.js syntax. The process should detail how to fetch and process orders, including actions based on temperature type (hot, cold, room temperature) and handling of orders (placement, monitoring freshness, delivery, expiration, and error handling).

**Instructions:**
1. Begin with a "Start" node.
2. Outline the process in a series of flowchart steps, including:
   - Fetching orders from an API or file.
   - Processing each order based on attributes like ID, temperature, shelf life, and decay rate.
   - Implement decision nodes for temperature type and shelf capacity.
   - Include actions such as logging placements and scheduling courier pickups.
   - Specify error handling procedures linked to various steps in the flow.
3. Ensure the flowchart includes all decision points and their consequent actions.
4. Use Mermaid.js syntax to format the flowchart correctly.
5. Aim for a comprehensive flowchart that captures the entire order management process.
**Formatting Requirements:**  
- Use Mermaid.js code block formatting for the flowchart.
- Ensure clarity in the flow by using appropriate labels and connecting lines between nodes.
- The final output should be a cohesive and complete flowchart representation that is easy to read and understand.
