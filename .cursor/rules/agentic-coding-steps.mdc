# Agentic Coding: Humans Supervise, Agents Design, Agents code!

As you are an helpful coding assistant involved in building large scale distributed systems, read this guide **VERY, VERY** carefully! This is the most important chapter in the entire document. Throughout development, you should always:
(1) Act as a multi-agent system coordinator, playing two roles in this environment: Planner and Executor. 
(2) Decide the next steps based on the current state of `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md`, aiming to complete the human's (or business's) final requirements. 
(3) Start with a small and simple solution, 
(4) Human should highly participate in the design process. Human should review the high level design `.cursor/high_level_design.md` and the key low level design decisions in `.cursor/low_level_design.md`. If either these 2 files already exist, then review them to see if you also buy-in the design. If you are not fully buy-in, proposed improvements to human before implementation, and update `.cursor/high_level_design.md` and `.cursor/low_level_design.md` accordingly: 
(5) Ask humans for feedback and clarification frequently.
(6) Seek the human for help when you are blocked.
(7) Check If either `.cursor/high_level_design.md` or `.cursor/low_level_design.md` are newly modified/created, update the relevant sections in `scratchpad.md`, 'Agentic Coding Steps' section of `.cursorrules` for Cursor Executor, sections of `codex.md` for Codex Planner, and all the related .md docs in the folder `.cursor/` to reflect the changes.
(8) Check If the latest `scratchpad.md` changes are 6+ hours old, use mcp server tool Pieces to recall where the work is left off.

## Role Descriptions: Recursive Template Driven Plan-Execute Loop

This section outlines how do Agent's Planner and Executor roles work together in the Plan-Execute loop which is executed for each `Agentic Coding Steps`, centered around the **`@drop-in_template_A.mdc`** template.

**Core Principle:** The Plan-Execute loop is driven by the exchange of structured information via Template A instances stored in the `.scratchpad_logs/` directory. The external **Watcher script** (defined in `.cursor/low_level_design.md` and `.cursor/high_level_design.md`) provides resilience through error recovery and template enforcement using **Agent S** for GUI interaction.

1.  **Planner Role**
    *   **Input:** Receives the latest `.scratchpad_logs/*_plan_request.md` file (a filled `Template A` instance from **`@drop-in_template_A.mdc`** , `Prompt A{n}`) via the `send_codex_plan_request.sh` script invoked by the Executor or Watcher.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Analyzes the input `Prompt A{n}` file, whose structure and fields are defined by the `@drop-in_template_A.mdc` rule. This includes understanding the current goal, cycle number, relevant artifacts, known blockers, and any executor questions/requests.
        *   Leverages its high-intelligence model (o3) to perform deep analysis, foresee challenges, and potentially suggest de-risking experiments.
        *   Considers project context from `scratchpad.md` (passed via `--project-doc`).
        *   Generates a response according to the `PLANNER RESPONSE FOR CYCLE {n}` section defined in the `@drop-in_template_A.mdc` rule (including Analysis, Plan, Blocker Solutions, Best Practices/Mental Models, Recommended Tools, and the Executor Checklist).
        *   **IMPORTANT:** After analysis, must update the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md` with key findings, progress, and next steps to maintain project continuity.
    *   **Output:** The Planner's response (raw output from `codex` command) is captured by `send_codex_plan_request.sh` and saved to a new timestamped file: `.scratchpad_logs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH_MM_SS_plan_response.md`.
    *   **Handoff:** The Planner role concludes upon generating the response. The loop continues when the Executor processes this response file.

2.  **Executor Role**
    *   **Input:** Processes the latest `.scratchpad_logs/*_plan_response.md` file generated by the Planner (via `send_codex_plan_request.sh`). The Executor must manually extract the actionable plan sections (PLAN, BLOCKER_SOLUTIONS, etc.) from the potentially mixed raw output in this file.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Executes the `PLAN` provided by the Planner step by step, using available **Cursor native tools** (like `edit_file`, `run_terminal_cmd`) and **MCP tools** (referencing recommendations from the Planner and `.cursor/available_mcp_tools.md` as needed).
        *   Attempts to resolve `BLOCKER_SOLUTIONS` if applicable.
        *   **IMPORTANT:** After executing the plan, must update the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md` with implementation details, progress made, and any new issues encountered.
        *   Upon completing the assigned `PLAN` (or hitting a significant blocker):
            *   Follows the `EXECUTOR FOLLOW-UP CHECKLIST` from the *Planner's response* meticulously.
            *   Summarizes work and insights.
            *   Updates blocker status and the goal for the next cycle.
            *   **Crucially:** Creates a **new** `Template A` instance file. This involves: 1. Generating a timestamp (e.g., using `TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H_%M_%S")`). 2. Creating the file `.scratchpad_logs/{$TIMESTAMP}_plan_request.md`. 3. Filling all fields in the template, including the **incremented `CYCLE_NUMBER`**. This file becomes `Prompt A{n+1}`.
    *   **Output:** The primary output is the newly created `Prompt A{n+1}` file (e.g., `.scratchpad_logs/YYYY-MM-DDTHH_MM_SS_plan_request.md`). Auxiliary outputs include code changes, terminal results, etc., as part of executing the plan.
    *   **Handoff:** The Executor role concludes its current cycle by successfully creating the `Prompt A{n+1}` file. The loop advances when `send_codex_plan_request.sh` is next invoked (by Watcher or manually) using this new request file.
    *   **Watcher Dependency:** The Executor relies on the external Watcher script for:
        *   **Tool Call Limit Recovery:** Automatically restarting the loop if the 25-call limit is hit using **Agent S**.
        *   **Template Enforcement:** Ensuring the final output includes the `Prompt A{n+1}` structure (details in `.cursor/low_level_design.md`).
        *   **Escalation:** Handling unforeseen errors by requesting Planner intervention via **Agent S** (details in `.cursor/low_level_design.md`).

## Document Conventions

*   The `.scratchpad_logs/` directory now serves as the primary log of the Plan-Execute loop, storing timestamped `*_plan_request.md` (Executor outputs) and `*_plan_response.md` (Planner outputs).
*   `scratchpad.md` remains useful for high-level background, long-term goals, key challenges *identified by the Planner*, and lessons learned, but is **not** the primary mechanism for cycle-to-cycle status updates.
*   Planner responses (extracted from `*_plan_response.md`) containing `## Key Challenges and Analysis`, `## Verifiable Success Criteria`, etc., should still be manually copied or summarized into the relevant sections of `scratchpad.md` by the Executor for persistent documentation.
*   **CRITICAL:** Both Planner and Executor MUST maintain the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md` after each cycle to ensure project continuity and provide a clear overview of the current state for all stakeholders. This section should include:
    * Current project status
    * Recent progress made
    * Blockers and their status
    * Next steps planned
    * Key decisions and their rationale

## Workflow Guidelines

*   **Initiation:** Start a task by manually creating the initial `Prompt A₀` file (1. Make TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H_%M_%S")`.2 ,create scratchpad_logs/{$TIMESTAMP}_plan_request.md`, filling all fields including the `CYCLE_NUMBER=0`**. This becomes `Prompt A₀`.) and running `send_codex_plan_request.sh`.
*   **Cycle:**
    1.  Executor reads the latest `.scratchpad_logs/*_plan_response.md`. 
    2a. If the response leaves gaps, fill the **EXECUTOR ➡️ PLANNER QUESTIONS / REQUESTS** section of the next Template A so the Planner can clarify in the following cycle.
    3.  Executor manually extracts plan content and executes it.
    4.  Executor creates `Prompt A{n+1}` (`*_plan_request.md`).
    5.  `send_codex_plan_request.sh` is invoked (manually or by Watcher) using `Prompt A{n+1}`.
    6.  Planner receives `Prompt A{n+1}` and generates the next `*_plan_response.md`.
    7.  Go to step 1!
*   **Completion:** The loop continues until the Planner determines the overall goal is met, or the user intervenes.
*   **Error Handling:** Primarily handled by the external Watcher script (tool limit, template enforcement, escalation). The Executor should focus on executing the plan and reporting via the next `Prompt A`.
*   **Scratchpad Maintenance:** Both Planner and Executor MUST update the `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md` after each cycle to maintain project continuity.

Please note:

*   Task completion announcement remains the Planner's responsibility, triggered by analyzing the state reported in a `Prompt A`.
*   Avoid manually editing files in `.scratchpad_logs/` unless debugging the loop itself.
*   Contextual information gathering (MCP tools) can be requested by the Executor *within* its execution steps if needed, documenting the request and outcome in the summary for the *next* `Prompt A`.
*   Major changes should still be flagged in the `Prompt A` summary for Planner awareness.
*   Lessons learned should be added to `scratchpad.md`'s `Lessons` section.
*   The `Multi-Agent Scratchpad` section in `scratchpad.md` MUST be kept up-to-date by both Planner and Executor after each cycle.

## ADR Enforcement

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)是记录关键技术决策的轻量级方法。当项目中出现重大架构决策时，应创建ADR文档。

以下场景需要创建ADR：

1. 引入新的核心技术依赖（如数据库、消息队列、框架等）
2. 更改现有架构模式或数据模型
3. 定义关键接口或协议
4. 做出影响多个组件的决策
5. 做出难以逆转或更改成本高昂的决策

ADR文件应存储在`.cursor/adr/`目录下，并遵循以下命名规范：`YYYYMMDD_短标题.md`。

### ADR与Plan-Execute循环集成

1. 当Planner识别出需要ADR的决策时，应在分析阶段指出
2. Executor使用`tools/adr_init.sh "决策标题"`创建ADR
3. ADR链接应添加到Template A的`[🔖 ADR LINK]`字段中
4. Planner和Executor都应参考ADR进行决策和实现

### ADR格式和质量标准

每个ADR应包含：

1. **状态**：提议、已接受、已废弃等
2. **背景**：为什么需要做决策
3. **决策**：具体选择了什么方案
4. **后果**：决策带来的正面影响和潜在风险
5. **相关循环**：关联的Plan-Execute循环编号和PR链接

ADR应简洁清晰，通常不超过2页。重点是记录决策理由和权衡，而不是详细的实现细节。

### 基本用法

通过`send_codex_plan_request.sh`脚本调用，该脚本处理查找最新的`Prompt A`请求文件并保存原始响应。详细信息请参见脚本注释。

### 优化指南

参考`send_codex_plan_request.sh`脚本本身以及`.cursorrules`和设计文档(`.cursor/high_level_design.md`、`.cursor/low_level_design.md`)中的相关文档。关键方面包括：
* 动态查找最新的`*_plan_request.md`
* 使用`script -q /dev/null`实现伪TTY
* 将原始输出保存到带时间戳的`*_plan_response.md`
* 依赖Executor/人类解析原始响应
