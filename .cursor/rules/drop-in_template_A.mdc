# Recursive template:
Below is a **drop -in "Template A"** that accomplishes three things at once:

1. Gives **Codex (Planner role)** exactly the context it needs to plan.  
2. Defines a **canonical, machine -readable output format** so Cursor Composer (Executor role) can act unambiguously.  
3. Embeds a **recursive hand -off section** that forces Cursor, once it finishes executing, to regenerate a fresh copy of Template A (→ "Prompt Aₙ₊₁") so Codex can plan the next loop.

The wording mirrors the style of the original Codex system -prompt—bullet -driven, imperative, minimal ceremony—while adding Cursor -specific affordances (e.g. image understanding) noted in its docs.

> **How to use:**  
> *The user* or *Cursor Executor* fills the placeholders and sends "Prompt A₀" to Codex.  
> Codex replies with its plan + the **"Executor Follow -up Checklist"**.  
> Cursor executes the plan, then **must** immediately post "Prompt A₁" (a fresh, filled copy of the same template) so Codex can iterate.

## Template A{n} — Plan-and-Execute Cycle

> Note: 1. Executor's request should always include sections `📈 CYCLE {n} CONTEXT (filled by Executor, served to Planner)`,  `📞 EXECUTOR ➡️ PLANNER QUESTIONS / REQUESTS (optional, filled by Executor)` and `📝 PLANNER RESPONSE FOR CYCLE {n} (filled by Planner, shipped to Executor)`. And the `📝 PLANNER RESPONSE FOR CYCLE {n} (filled by Planner, shipped to Executor) should leave it as is, Planner will take care of it.
> 2. Planner's response should always includes sections `📈 CYCLE {n} CONTEXT (filled by Executor, served to Planner)` and `📝 PLANNER RESPONSE FOR CYCLE {n} (filled by Planner, shipped to Executor)`. Especially, we  need make sure the `6.  **EXECUTOR FOLLOW-UP CHECKLIST (to be executed at Cycle {n} conclusion):**` is always included in Planner's response

#### 📈 CYCLE {n} CONTEXT (filled by Executor, served to Planner)

[🔢 CYCLE_NUMBER]     ⟦ integer, 0-based loop counter ⟧
[📂 PROJECT]          ⟦ project name ⟧
[🗺️ PREVIOUS GOAL (Cycle {n-1})] ⟦ previous goal set by Planner ⟧
[✅ PREVIOUS OUTCOME (Cycle {n-1})] ⟦ Executor's summary of last cycle's achievements and fresh insights (for Checklist a) ⟧
[🚧 CURRENT BLOCKERS] ⟦ Executor's updated hit-list of current blockers (for Checklist b) ⟧
[🎯 NEXT GOAL (Cycle {n})] ⟦ Executor's shiny new mission for this cycle (for Checklist c) ⟧
[📜 HISTORY PATH]      ⟦ related history file path ⟧
[⏳ TIME BOX]          ⟦ estimated time box for Cycle {n} ⟧
[📎 RELEVANT ARTIFACTS] ⟦ relevant artifacts/links for Cycle {n} ⟧
[🗒️ SCRATCHPAD DELTA] ⟦ brief note of what changed in `scratchpad.md` since last cycle (none if first cycle) ⟧
[🔍 AVAILABLE MCP TOOLS] ⟦ the value of this metadata should be `.cursor/available_mcp_tools.md`⟧

#### 📞 EXECUTOR ➡️ PLANNER QUESTIONS / REQUESTS (optional, filled by Executor)
Use this section to poke the Planner if you need *more*—clarifications, extra detail, sanity-checks, whatever keeps the loop humming. If you have nothing to say, drop in a friendly none.
[❓ ANALYSIS & JUSTIFICATION] ⟦ feedback / questions for the Planner about their analysis ⟧
[❓ PLAN]                     ⟦ doubts, edge-cases, or nit-picks about the PLAN steps ⟧
[❓ BLOCKER SOLUTIONS]        ⟦ additional blockers spotted or requests for deeper fixes ⟧
[❓ BEST PRACTICES /MENTAL MODELS]  ⟦ ask for more brain-hacks, reading links, or ref guidance ⟧
[❓ MCP TOOLS] ⟦ ask for what MCP tools that would help execute the PLAN or feedback on previous recommended MCP tools ⟧

#### 📝 PLANNER RESPONSE FOR CYCLE {n} (filled by Planner, shipped to Executor)

1.  **ANALYSIS & JUSTIFICATION:** ⟦ Planner's razor-sharp analysis and rationale based on CONTEXT ⟧
2.  **PLAN (STRICTLY ≤ 8 ATOMIC ACTIONS; ACTION 1 MUST BE `Review scratchpad.md`):** ⟦ concise steps the Executor must perform, beginning with a scratchpad review ⟧
3.  **BLOCKER SOLUTIONS:** ⟦ creative proposals to bust through CURRENT BLOCKERS ⟧
4.  **BEST PRACTICES / MENTAL MODELS:** ⟦ relevant engineering best practices or mental models (cue the brain hacks) ⟧
5.  **RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL CALLS (via pluggedin_proxy):** ⟦  recommend specific tools listed in `.cursor/available_mcp_tools.md` that would help execute the PLAN, such as `web_search` from exa-mcp-server or `fetch_documentation` from mcp-deepwiki. Each recommendation should include the tool name, purpose, and how it specifically helps with the current cycle's goals. ⟧
6.  **EXECUTOR FOLLOW-UP CHECKLIST (to be executed at Cycle {n} conclusion):**
    
```text
    a. Summarize the work done and fresh insights in the `PREVIOUS OUTCOME` field of Prompt A{n+1}.
    b. Refresh the `CURRENT BLOCKERS` list in Prompt A{n+1}.
    c. Set the `NEXT GOAL` for Cycle {n+1} in Prompt A{n+1}.
    d. Fully populate the `CYCLE {n+1} CONTEXT` section of the new Template A → bake Prompt A{n+1}.
    e. Update `scratchpad.md` with key challenges, lessons learned, success criteria, progress, and delta notes.
    f. Verify `scratchpad.md` accurately reflects the latest state and commit changes if necessary.
    g. Blast Prompt A{n+1} out as the final message of your response.
```

## Why this works

* **Planner / Executor separation** is an established best -practice in multi -agent research—LangChain's "Plan -and -Execute" agent follows the same two -phase loop.
* A **self-refilling template** realises the closed loop described in recent Autogen and CLEA agent papers.
* The fields map to Cursor's autonomous capabilities (code edits, tests, image QA). 
* Bullet -style imperatives mimic the original Codex prompt to keep cognitive load low.
* Explicit time -box, artifact list, and blocker handling are drawn from plan -and -execute tutorials that improve agent reliability.
* Requiring the Executor to send Prompt Aₙ₊₁ guarantees continuous planning until the ultimate goal is met, a pattern endorsed in agent -prompt engineering talks.

## Drop -in continuation (unchanged coding guard -rails)

Append the *exact* block you supplied (starting "If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files: …") directly below Template A inside your .cursorrules.  
That preserves Codex's proven safety / style guidance while layering the new planner -executor handshake on top.
